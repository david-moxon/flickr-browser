# flickr-browser
A tool for easily browsing and viewing public photos on Flickr

This is my submission for the Holiday Extras tech assessment!

It's a React/Redux app built in ES6 JavaScript, transpiled through Babel.

It consumes the Flickr API to allow users to browse and view publically available photos.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:david-moxon/flickr-browser.git
```

2. Go to the root directory

```
cd flickr-browser
```

3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Run the dev server

```
npm run dev-open
```

## Further Changes

Things I would like to do to improve this:

- Fade out the preview when moving off the photo
- Correct the preview showing off-screen for those toward the right-hand side of the page
- Correctly format the total number of photos in the heading (e.g. "Showing 13,241 photos...")
