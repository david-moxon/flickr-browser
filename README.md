# flickr-browser
A tool for easily browsing and viewing public photos on Flickr

This is my submission for the Holiday Extras tech assessment!

It's a React/Redux app built in ES6 JavaScript, transpiled through Babel.

It consumes the Flickr API to allow users to browse and view publically available photos.
